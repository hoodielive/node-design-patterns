23 NodeJS Design Patterns 

'Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core
of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing
it the same way twice.'

                                        - Christopher Alexander, A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction 

Design Pattern Essentials: 
  - Pattern name
  - The problem
  - The solution 
  - Consequences 

Creational <deals with Class instantiation (the creation of object instances)> 
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder 
  - Factory Method
  - Prototype 
  - Singleton 

Structural <deals with the 'way' objects are composed> 
  - Adapter 
  - Bridge
  - Composite 
  - Decorator
  - Facade 
  - Flyweight 
  - Proxy 

Behavorial <defines how objects interact with each other> 
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command 
  - Interpreter 
  - Interator 
  - Mediator 
  - Memento 
  - Observer 
  - State 
  - Strategy
  - Tempate Method 
  - Visitor 


Other Patterns:
  - Module 
  - Revealing Module
  - Revealing Constructor 
  - Callback 
  - Middleware

AntiPatterns (Bad solutions that cause problems and thus should be avoided)
  (code smells)

  - Modifying the prototype on an instance: 
    person.__proto__.address = {}; 
  
  - Syncing execution after initialization 
    listen() {
      fs.readFileSync( ... ); // really bad idea as this will make your code slow and irritate users  
    }

  - Callback hell (chaos)
